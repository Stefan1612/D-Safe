# D-Tweets

## Problem statement

Nowadays social media plays a big role in our society.
Twitter is one of the leading platforms. Sometimes bigger influencer's tweet very questionable statements to push a certain non-logical statement towards their followers. Those statements can be very harming towards specifically younger individuals.
Due to the nature of "internet consequences" they sometimes (rarely ever) face repercussions for their actions which may consist of straight racism, sexism etc...

If they DO start to face a backlash, they can simple delete the post, video, tweet, etc... and act like nothing happened.

Examples: All the crypto NFT scams over the last year?
Racism

## Our solution

This Dapp should provide ONE part of the solution. It's not near where it could be and there are still a lot of untackled parameters.

D Safe (There probably will be a name change) allows anyone to easily save controversial statements within a few seconds.
Not only creating one version locally (like a screenshot would), it allows the user to create a publicly visible and undeniable version (e.g. Influencer NFT Twitter Scams).
